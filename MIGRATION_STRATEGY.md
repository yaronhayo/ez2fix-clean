## üó∫Ô∏è URL MAPPING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Direct URL Preservation (Recommended)
**Best Practice:** Keep all URLs identical to maintain maximum SEO value

```
OLD DOMAIN: https://ez2fixllc.com/[page]
NEW DOMAIN: https://newdomain.com/[page]

REDIRECT: 301 Permanent Redirect
```

### Phase 2: Strategic URL Improvements (If Needed)
*Only implement if current URLs have SEO issues*

#### Service Pages Enhancement
```
OLD: /services/garage-door-spring-repair
NEW: /services/garage-door-spring-repair-nj
REASON: Enhanced local targeting
```

#### Location Pages Enhancement  
```
OLD: /service-areas/north-caldwell
NEW: /garage-door-repair/north-caldwell-nj
REASON: Keyword-rich URL structure
```

### Phase 3: URL Consolidation
*Merge duplicate or low-performing pages*

```
CONSOLIDATE: /service-areas/north-caldwell-complete ‚Üí /service-areas/north-caldwell
REASON: Avoid content duplication
```
