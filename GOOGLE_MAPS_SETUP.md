# Google Maps Setup Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ
The Google Maps integration has been **fixed** and simplified to work with Astro's static build process.

## What Was Changed
1. **Removed API endpoint approach** - The `/api/maps-config` endpoint was causing issues because static builds can't access runtime environment variables
2. **Implemented direct environment variable injection** - Using Astro's `define:vars` to inject the API key directly into the client-side script at build time
3. **Simplified the code path** - No more fetch calls or complex async loading, just direct access to the environment variable

## How It Works Now
1. The `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable is injected into the client-side script during the build process
2. The script checks if a valid API key is available (not the placeholder value)
3. If valid, it loads the Google Maps JavaScript API with the key
4. If not valid, it shows a fallback error message

## üö® ISSUE EXPLANATION

The maps are showing "‚ùå No valid Google Maps API key available" because:
1. **Local Development**: The `.env` file has `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=local_development_placeholder`
2. **Production**: The environment variable needs to be set in Vercel's dashboard

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION STEPS

### For Production Deployment (Required)
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select your ez2fix project**
3. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. **Add New Variable**:
   - **Name**: `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Google Maps API key (starts with AIza...)
   - **Environments**: ‚úÖ Production, ‚úÖ Preview, ‚úÖ Development
5. **Click Save**
6. **Redeploy** your site (go to Deployments ‚Üí click "‚ãØ" ‚Üí Redeploy)

### For Local Testing (Optional)
Edit `.env` file:
```bash
# Replace this line:
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=local_development_placeholder

# With your actual API key:
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## üîë Getting a Google Maps API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable **Maps JavaScript API**
4. Go to **Credentials** ‚Üí **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **API Key**
5. **Restrict the API key**:
   - Application restrictions: HTTP referrers
   - Website restrictions: Add your domain (ez2fixllc.com)
6. Copy the API key

## Verification
The maps should now load correctly on the `/service-areas` page with:
- Interactive map with colored markers for different service area types
- Clickable markers with detailed information windows
- Responsive zoom levels based on screen size
- Proper error handling if the API key is missing

## Why This Fix Works
- **Static Build Compatible**: Uses build-time variable injection instead of runtime API calls
- **Secure**: API key is only exposed to the client when it's properly configured
- **Reliable**: No network dependencies during page load for configuration
- **Simple**: Direct, straightforward approach without unnecessary complexity

The Google Maps functionality is now **production-ready** once the environment variable is configured in Vercel.
