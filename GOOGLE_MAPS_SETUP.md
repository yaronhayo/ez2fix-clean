# Google Maps Setup Guide

## Current Status ✅
The Google Maps integration has been **fixed** and simplified to work with Astro's static build process.

## What Was Changed
1. **Removed API endpoint approach** - The `/api/maps-config` endpoint was causing issues because static builds can't access runtime environment variables
2. **Implemented direct environment variable injection** - Using Astro's `define:vars` to inject the API key directly into the client-side script at build time
3. **Simplified the code path** - No more fetch calls or complex async loading, just direct access to the environment variable

## How It Works Now
1. The `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable is injected into the client-side script during the build process
2. The script checks if a valid API key is available (not the placeholder value)
3. If valid, it loads the Google Maps JavaScript API with the key
4. If not valid, it shows a fallback error message

## 🚨 ISSUE EXPLANATION

The maps are showing "❌ No valid Google Maps API key available" because:
1. **Local Development**: The `.env` file has `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=local_development_placeholder`
2. **Production**: The environment variable needs to be set in Vercel's dashboard

## ✅ SOLUTION STEPS

### For Production Deployment (Required)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: The environment variable must be available during BUILD TIME, not just runtime!**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select your ez2fix project**
3. **Go to Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **Add New Variable**:
   - **Name**: `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Google Maps API key (starts with AIza...)
   - **Environments**: ✅ Production, ✅ Preview, ✅ Development
5. **Click Save**
6. **IMPORTANT: Redeploy** your site (go to Deployments → click "⋯" → Redeploy)

### 🔍 Verification Steps
After deployment, check browser console on /service-areas page:
- ✅ **Should see**: `"Build-time API key set: Valid key detected"`
- ❌ **If you see**: `"Using placeholder - check Vercel env vars"` → Environment variable not set during build

### 🚨 Troubleshooting
If it's still not working after setting the environment variable:
1. **Double-check the variable name**: Must be exactly `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
2. **Check all environments are selected**: Production, Preview, Development
3. **Verify the API key**: Should start with `AIzaSy...` and be ~39 characters long
4. **Force redeploy**: Delete old deployments and create new one
5. **Check browser console**: Look for the debug messages to see what key is being used

### For Local Testing (Optional)
Edit `.env` file:
```bash
# Replace this line:
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=local_development_placeholder

# With your actual API key:
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## 🔑 Getting a Google Maps API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable **Maps JavaScript API**
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **API Key**
5. **Restrict the API key**:
   - Application restrictions: HTTP referrers
   - Website restrictions: Add your domain (ez2fixllc.com)
6. Copy the API key

## Verification
The maps should now load correctly on the `/service-areas` page with:
- Interactive map with colored markers for different service area types
- Clickable markers with detailed information windows
- Responsive zoom levels based on screen size
- Proper error handling if the API key is missing

## Why This Fix Works
- **Static Build Compatible**: Uses build-time variable injection instead of runtime API calls
- **Secure**: API key is only exposed to the client when it's properly configured
- **Reliable**: No network dependencies during page load for configuration
- **Simple**: Direct, straightforward approach without unnecessary complexity

The Google Maps functionality is now **production-ready** once the environment variable is configured in Vercel.
