# Google Maps Setup Guide

## Current Status ✅
The Google Maps integration has been **fixed** and simplified to work with Astro's static build process.

## What Was Changed
1. **Removed API endpoint approach** - The `/api/maps-config` endpoint was causing issues because static builds can't access runtime environment variables
2. **Implemented direct environment variable injection** - Using Astro's `define:vars` to inject the API key directly into the client-side script at build time
3. **Simplified the code path** - No more fetch calls or complex async loading, just direct access to the environment variable

## How It Works Now
1. The `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable is injected into the client-side script during the build process
2. The script checks if a valid API key is available (not the placeholder value)
3. If valid, it loads the Google Maps JavaScript API with the key
4. If not valid, it shows a fallback error message

## For Production Deployment in Vercel

**CRITICAL**: The environment variable `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` must be set in Vercel's dashboard:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your actual Google Maps API key (starts with AIza...)
   - **Environments**: Check all three: Production, Preview, Development

## For Local Testing
Replace the placeholder value in `.env`:
```bash
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Verification
The maps should now load correctly on the `/service-areas` page with:
- Interactive map with colored markers for different service area types
- Clickable markers with detailed information windows
- Responsive zoom levels based on screen size
- Proper error handling if the API key is missing

## Why This Fix Works
- **Static Build Compatible**: Uses build-time variable injection instead of runtime API calls
- **Secure**: API key is only exposed to the client when it's properly configured
- **Reliable**: No network dependencies during page load for configuration
- **Simple**: Direct, straightforward approach without unnecessary complexity

The Google Maps functionality is now **production-ready** once the environment variable is configured in Vercel.
